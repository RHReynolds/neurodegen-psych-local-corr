# Background
This repository contains code to determine local and global genetic correlations between several neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders with LAVA and LDSC, respectively.

# Code contents

Within this repository you will find:

| Directory | Description |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [docs](docs) | Contains all `.Rmd`s and their corresponding `.html`s describing analyses performed for this project. These can be view interactively at: [https://rhreynolds.github.io/neurodegen-psych-local-corr/](https://rhreynolds.github.io/neurodegen-psych-local-corr/)|
| [logs](logs) | For any scripts that were run outside of an `.Rmd` (e.g. scripts from the [scripts](scripts) directory), a log file was recorded and can be accessed here. |
| [man](man) | Figures used in `.Rmd`s. |
| [R](R)| Various functions called in [docs](docs) and [scripts](scripts). |
| [raw_data](raw_data) | External tables used in analyses. |
| [renv](renv) | `renv`-related scripts- |
| [results](results) | Results from all analyses. |
| [scripts](scripts) | Contains analysis scripts. Each script contains a one-line description and is also referenced in its corresponding `.Rmd`. |

# Reproducibility
This repository uses [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) to create a reproducible environment for this R project. 

1. When you first launches this project, `renv` should automatically bootstrap itself, thereby downloading and installing the appropriate version of `renv` into the project library. 
2. After this has completed, you can use `renv::restore()` to restore the project library locally on your machine.

For more information on collaborating with `renv`, please refer to this [link](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/collaborating.html).
